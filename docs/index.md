> May 23, 2018. The [VC3 project](http://www.virtualclusters.org) is searching for users and HPC resource providers to evaluate its closed-beta (or "limited") release.  During the limited beta release there might be system bugs, instability and lack of availability. 

* The limited beta user invitation signup is [here](http://bit.ly/vc3-signup). 
* The limited beta HPC resource invitation is [here](http://bit.ly/vc3-new-resource).  Note you do not necessarily need to have an institutional affiliation with the HPC resource organization, but you should be authorized to run jobs there.

resource for collaborative science.
