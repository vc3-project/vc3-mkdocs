> May 23, 2018. The [VC3 project](http://www.virtualclusters.org) is searching for users and HPC resources to evaluate its closed-beta release.  The VC3 user closed beta invitation signup is [here](http://bit.ly/vc3-signup). If you would like to add an HPC resource to the VC3 platform for testing, please complete this [form](http://bit.ly/vc3-new-resource).  You do not necessarily need to have an institutional affiliation with the HPC resource organization, but should have an allocation to run jobs there.  

## Getting Started With VC3

cluster frameworks to make disparate resources appear as a single “virtual”
resource for collaborative science.
