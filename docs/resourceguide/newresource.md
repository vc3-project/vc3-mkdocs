# Adding a resource to VC3

The [VC3 project](http://www.virtualclusters.org) is searching for HPC resources to evaluate its closed-beta release.  If you would like to add an HPC resource to the VC3 platform for testing, please complete this [form](http://bit.ly/vc3-signup). You do not necessarily need to have an institutional affiliation with the HPC resource organization, but should have an allocation to run jobs there.  The VC3 user closed beta invitation signup is [here](http://bit.ly/vc3-signup).

## Requirements

* Cluster must have one of the following batch systems: Slurm, HTCondor, PBS, or Grid Engine.
* Compute nodes must have outbound IP connectivity.
* The login node of the resource must be directly reachable via ssh (i.e., has a public IP) and not require MFA.
